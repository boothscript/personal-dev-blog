# My Remote Bootcamp Experience: Twitter Clone Group Project

## intro

- told about kanban boards and tickets but wasn't given much direction
- was a very broad brief
- mobile first design

## Breaking the project down into tasks

- used fire fox dev tools to screen shot twitter in different device modes
- used figma to share these with the team
- seperated page into components and wrote specifications for each
- nice to have section

## Global CSS and CSS Variables were invaluable

- setting out colors, some utility classes and icons
- a little work up front save time for all
- Allowed team to have something that "looked like twitter" from the outset - great for confidence

## Adding CI/CD

- used github actions
- eslint on pr requests
- left deployment to last minute

## Git Issues

- using merge vs rebase
- As time the deadline loomed, best practices went out the window
- node_modules, react project not being in the root folder
- people not branching off latest main

## Managing scope and feature creep

- attempts were made to manage feature creep and take away stress but ultimately failed
- as complexity increased, I spent more time guiding others than completeing tasks
