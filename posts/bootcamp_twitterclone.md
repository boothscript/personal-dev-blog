# My Remote Bootcamp Experience: Twitter Clone Group Project

## intro

- told about kanban boards and tickets but wasn't given much direction
- was a very broad brief
- mobile first design

After 6 weeks of intense learning, our cohort was split into small groups for our first group project. The brief was brief and vague; to build a twitter clone front end with a mobile first approach. We were expected to use git but the rest how we would manage the project was up too us as a team. This surprised me a little as learning more about project management was one of my key aims of the course. We were strongly encouraged to use kanban boards and issue tickets however.

## Breaking the project down into tasks

- used fire fox dev tools to screen shot twitter in different device modes
- used figma to share these with the team
- seperated page into components and wrote specifications for each
- nice to have section

As a group, we decided to breakdown the project into smaller components, and I suggested me use Figma as a tool to help us do this. Figma worked really well, i was quickly able to make a number of boards at different sizes and screen capture the necessary device renders with the firefox devtools. With Figma's multiplayer mode we we able to discuss the images together as a team without the hassle of having to bounce around each others discord streams, something we have be come far too aware of working remotely.

We added a COMPONENTS column to our kanban board started to create cards. We then listed the visual elements needed for each card and discussed functionality. Figma gave us what we wanted to in terms of being able to talk about the higher level components together, however it lacked any interactivity information and as we started to look at the site on our own devices the complexity grew. To temper the increased scope we added a NICE TO HAVE column to our project board.

## Global CSS and CSS Variables were invaluable

- setting out colors, some utility classes and icons
- a little work up front save time for all
- Allowed team to have something that "looked like twitter" from the outset - great for confidence

## Adding CI/CD

- used github actions
- eslint on pr requests
- left deployment to last minute

## Git Issues

- using merge vs rebase
- As time the deadline loomed, best practices went out the window
- node_modules, react project not being in the root folder
- people not branching off latest main

## Managing scope and feature creep

- attempts were made to manage feature creep and take away stress but ultimately failed
- as complexity increased, I spent more time guiding others than completeing tasks
